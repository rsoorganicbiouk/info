The 10ml syringes have the possibility to extract precisely 0.01ml with a turn on the piston of the syringe, while the 1ml syringes have a scale bar, divided over 100 units printed on their side and allowing you to extract 0.01ml similarly.

The effects and dosage are different per person. You can start with a small amount and gradually increase the dosage until you find the dosage that is most satisfying and has the least side-effects (like tiredness or nausea, also depends from person to person). Your body eventually builds up tolerance against the side-effects.

Feeling drowsy, tired and sleepy is a normal reaction. Sleeping 8 to 10 hours a day is also normal.
If you do not feel well after intake (nausea or dizziness), then you could take a glass of water with honey or anything sweet. 

Storage:
Allow the oil to come to room temperature before administering. Place the syringe or glass bottle in a warm water bath if you have difficulty with extracting the oil. The oil can best be kept in a cool and dark place. Placing it inside a fridge will slightly improve the taste.

The strain used to produce the RSO-oil is called "Northern Lights".
